# L100: Foundations, AI on Databricks for AkzoNobel

Start here. Learn to call AI from SQL and build the no code Agent Bricks agents, using only managed Databricks services over synthetic AkzoNobel coatings data. No agent code required at this tier.

## What You Will Build

| Capability | Powered By |
|---|---|
| AI from pure SQL (classify, extract, parse, summarize, mask, forecast) | SQL AI Functions |
| Natural language data queries | Genie Space |
| Document Q and A over safety sheets and policies | Knowledge Assistant |
| Field extraction and PDF parsing | Information Extraction, Document Parsing |
| Ticket and email triage | Text Classification |
| Your first coded agent that calls a tool | OpenAI Agents SDK plus one MCP tool |
| Quality evaluation and human feedback | MLflow Tracing, LLM Judges, Review App |

## The Three Spines (and where L100 sits)

The workshop deepens three capabilities across L100, L200, and L300. At L100 you meet the starting point of each.

| Spine | L100 (here) |
|---|---|
| Agent Bricks types | Build the single purpose types: Genie, Knowledge Assistant, Extraction, Parsing, Classification, plus a coded agent |
| MCP | Consume one read only MCP tool from a coded agent |
| Agents that act | None yet. Everything here is read only. Actions arrive in L200 |
| LLMOps | MLflow evaluation, one LLM judge, tracing, and `ai_mask` for governance |

## Get Started

Work through the materials in order.

1. `00_sql_ai_functions.ipynb` Call AI from SQL alone. The lowest barrier entry point and the reference for every function used later.
2. `01_agent_bricks_types.md` Build the no code Agent Bricks agents in the UI, on the same tables and documents.
3. `02_simple_agent_evaluation.ipynb` Evaluate an agent with MLflow and a single LLM judge.
4. `03_short_term_memory.ipynb` Give an agent short term memory backed by Lakebase.
5. `L100-agent-openai-sdk/` Your first coded agent. It answers questions and consumes one read only MCP tool.

The shared data setup in the repo root `data/` folder must run once before this tier. It loads the coatings tables, the document volume, the Genie spaces, and the vector index.

---

## Prerequisites

- Databricks workspace with serverless SQL compute
- Foundation Model API access (for example Llama 3.3 70B or Claude Sonnet)
- Unity Catalog with permission to read the workshop catalog
- Vector Search and Databricks Apps enabled
- Shared data setup completed (see `../data/`)

Nothing to install locally for the SQL and UI labs. The coded agent uses `uv`.

---

## How the Notebooks Run

Every query is driven from Python through `spark.sql(...)` with the catalog and model endpoint read from notebook widgets. Nothing is hardcoded, the catalog and endpoint are validated before use, and the same notebook runs identically in an interactive session and as a scheduled job. Set the `catalog` and `llm_endpoint` widgets at the top, then run top to bottom.

## Next

Move up to `../L200-capabilities/` to add tools, memory, an MCP server you build yourself, and the first agent that takes an action behind a human approval gate.

> Note: all data is synthetic. Product names, accounts, suppliers, and documents are invented for the workshop.

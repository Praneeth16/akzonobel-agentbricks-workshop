"""Action Plane — the canonical action record + state machine over Lakebase.

This is the *one governed plane* every AkzoNobel agent acts through. An agent
`propose()`s an action (status `proposed`); a human (or, at L4, policy) drives it
through `approved → executing → executed`, or it `rejected`/`escalated`/`failed`.
Every transition appends an `action_events` row, so the full lineage of who did
what, when, and why is always reconstructable from `action_events`.

At L200 every policy carries `requires_approval = true`, so an action cannot move
past `proposed` without an explicit human approval. L300 introduces the L1–L4
autonomy ladder that lets a within-policy action auto-approve.

State machine (enforced — illegal transitions raise):

    proposed ──approve──▶ approved ──mark_executing──▶ executing ──mark_executed──▶ executed
       │                     │                            │
       ├──reject──▶ rejected │                            └──mark_failed──▶ failed
       │                     │
       └──escalate─┐         └──escalate──▶ escalated
                   ▼
               escalated  (also reachable from approved/executing on a guardrail breach)

`escalated` is reachable from any non-terminal state: a guardrail breach found
at any point pulls the action back to a human gate rather than letting it run.

# AkzoNobel Agent Bricks Workshop

### Build production grade AI agents on Databricks, one tier at a time.

A progressive, hands on workshop that takes you from calling AI in SQL to a governed multi domain supervisor, on synthetic AkzoNobel coatings data. It ends with a hackathon starter kit your teams can fork.

## What this is

A practical guide to building real AI agents on Databricks, not toy demos. You climb three tiers, and every tier carries the same lifecycle: build, evaluate, govern, deploy, improve. The three capabilities that matter most deepen as you go: the Agent Bricks agent types, the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and agents that take real actions.

> Note: all data is synthetic. Product names, accounts, suppliers, and documents are invented for the workshop.

## The ladder

| Tier | Folder | You build |
|---|---|---|
| L100 Foundations | `L100-foundations/` | AI from SQL, the no code Agent Bricks types, your first coded agent, evaluation, and memory |
| L200 Capabilities | `L200-capabilities/` | Tool calling, an MCP server you build, Lakebase memory, deployment, and the first agent that acts behind a human approval gate |
| L300 Use case | `L300-usecase/` | The flagship multi domain supervisor across Finance, Supply Chain, and Commercial, with the full action ladder and production monitoring |
| Hackathon kit | `hackathon-starter-kit/` | Forkable tracks, starter prompts, ai dev kit skills, and the event hub app |

Each tier is self contained. Start at L100, or jump in where you need to.

## The three spines

The workshop is organized around three capabilities that grow tier over tier.

| Spine | L100 | L200 | L300 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agent Bricks types | Build the single purpose types | Add tools to a coded agent | Supervisor composes them all |
| MCP | Consume one read only tool | Build and register a server | Wire the full fleet |
| Agents that act | None, read only | One or two connectors with human approval | All connectors, an approval ladder, and an audit trail |
| LLMOps | Evaluation, one judge, tracing | Judge suite, AI Gateway, guardrails | Production monitoring, lineage, advanced evaluation |

## Get started

### 1. Clone this repo into your Databricks workspace

The whole workshop runs from a Databricks **Git folder** (Repos), so you get the
notebooks, data generators, and starter kit in one place and can pull updates as
new tiers land.

**Option A — UI (recommended)**

1. In your Databricks workspace sidebar, click **Workspace → Users → your user**.
2. Click **Create → Git folder** (top right).
3. Paste the repo URL and confirm the details:
   - **Git repository URL:** `https://github.com/Praneeth16/akzonobel-agentbricks-workshop.git`
   - **Git provider:** GitHub
   - **Branch:** `main`
4. Click **Create Git folder**. The repo clones to
   `/Workspace/Users/<you>/akzonobel-agentbricks-workshop`.
5. To get later updates, open the Git folder and click **⋯ → Git… → Pull**.

> Private repo? Add a GitHub Personal Access Token first under
> **Settings → Linked accounts (Git integration)**, then clone.

**Option B — Databricks CLI (from your laptop)**

```bash
databricks repos create \
  --url https://github.com/Praneeth16/akzonobel-agentbricks-workshop.git \
  --provider gitHub \
  --path /Workspace/Users/<you>/akzonobel-agentbricks-workshop
```

> On **Vocareum**, you don't clone — the course bundle is preloaded. Start from the
> first lab in the agenda.

### 2. Run the workshop

1. Run the shared data setup once. See `data/`. It loads the coatings tables, the document volume, the Genie spaces, and the vector index into Unity Catalog.
2. Open `L100-foundations/` and follow its README.
3. Climb the ladder.

## Prerequisites

- Databricks workspace with serverless SQL compute and Unity Catalog
- Foundation Model API access (for example Llama 3.3 70B or Claude Sonnet)
- Vector Search, Lakebase, and Databricks Apps enabled
- Permission to read the workshop catalog

---

## What's included

The workshop is built tier by tier. Each tier is runnable end to end on a Databricks workspace.

| Item | What it gives you |
|---|---|
| `data/` generators and `load_to_uc.py` | The shared coatings dataset across Finance, SCM, and Commercial |
| `data/setup/setup_genie_spaces.py` | Three Genie spaces, one per domain |
| `data/setup/setup_vector_search.py` | The document vector index for the Knowledge Assistant |
| `L100-foundations/00_sql_ai_functions.ipynb` | AI from SQL: `ai_query`, `ai_forecast`, `ai_extract`, and more |
| `L100-foundations/01_agent_bricks_types.md` | The no-code Agent Bricks types, UI and programmatic paths |
| `L100-foundations/02_agent_evaluation.ipynb` | Evaluation with MLflow judges |
| `L100-foundations/03_short_term_memory.ipynb` | Conversation memory on Lakebase |
| `L100-foundations/L100-agent-langgraph/` | Your first coded agent: LangGraph + managed MCP, deployable on Databricks Apps |
| `L200-capabilities/` | Tool calling, an MCP server you build, Lakebase memory, and the first agent that acts behind a human approval gate |
| `L300-usecase/` | The flagship multi-domain supervisor with the full action ladder and production monitoring |
| `hackathon-starter-kit/` | 11 forkable tracks, starter prompts, ai-dev-kit skills, and the AppKit hackathon hub |

To deploy a coded agent (L100–L300) on Databricks Apps, pass your catalog at deploy time and grant the app's service principal access to the data it reads. Each tier's README has the exact commands.
